# MarkovDecisionProcesses
A project on Markov decision processes for Georgia Tech University

I used an anaconda interpreter set to python 3.6. All of the packages loaded are specified in the requirements.txt file. You can create the exact anaconda interpreter I used by loading the pacakges found in the requirements file.

All of the source code is in the main.py file and the algorithms.py file. The main file is essentially a play ground to apply the algorithms in the 
algorithms file with different parameters.

To repeat the analysis I did just set the parameters mentioned in my report and then call the respective function which will be named after the process you are trying to repeat. Much of the code is commented out to reduce the runtime of the analysis at various parts, so you can un comment and comment code freely to view different pieces of the analysis.
